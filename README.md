Tiny Agent
==========

This is a very minimal AI Agent implementation as a Python package and
command line interface.

You need an OpenAI API key from <https://platform.openai.com/api-keys>.
Define that API key as environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`. Then run

```bash
uv run tinyagent/agent.py
```
